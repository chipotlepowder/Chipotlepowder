Teachers once tenured have nothing motivating them to perform. Giving students, parents/guardians, school board, companies, etc. The ability to pay great teachers for excellent teaching skills will make students excel.  Students are also motivated by incentive.  
Giving students NFT's for in-game items and a multitude of other tokenized options will bring out their spirit to learn like nothing else.
This system will be governed by all involved.  Teachers can reward students for good behavior in class, grades, special achievements, and so on. 
Manipulation can be controlled by transparency.
